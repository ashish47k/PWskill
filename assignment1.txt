Q7)
Immutable data types are those whose values cannot be modified after they are created. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object with the modified value. Examples of immutable data types include numbers (int, float), strings, and tuples.
ex) var1 = 'pwskills'
    var2 = var1
    var2 = var2 + ' is awesome'
    print(vara) #output pwskills
    print(var2) #output pwskills is awesome

Mutable data types are those whose values can be modified after they are created. Any operation that appears to modify an immitable object actually modified the value. Examples of mutable data type include list, set, and dictionaries.
ex) var1 = [1,2,3]
    var2 = var1
    var2[0] = 2
    print(var1) #output [2,2,3]
    print(var2) #output [2,2,3]
